# RealtimeFaceLock
Cool script that will completely disable your computer's keyboard and mouse while you're away.
This script will make your keyboard and mouse usable when you are using it, and it will disable them totally when you are away.
It uses your face as key to lock/unlock the keyboard and mouse. People who don't know about this script will think your keyboard 
and mouse are not working.

!!!WARNING!!!
Taking a blurry picture may make your computer completely unusable. But you can still open task manager by pressing ctrl+alt+del, 
and restart your system to end the script.

Requirement:
- OpenCV
- Pilow
- pythoncom
- pyhook

Usage:
1. Run the script
2. Wait for a camera window to appear
3. Press 'Space' bar to take a picture of your face as the lock
4. Enjoy!
